        HELLO!! Welcome to my website. Here I put everything about my projects
        that I make. I am <span id="age">14</span>. I like coding and would like
        to mention the name of "The Coding Train" youtube channel from where I
        have learnt a lot of things. I also want to acknowledge my family and
